#summary Some frequently asked questions.

=== 1. Why not use NAnt? ===
  * Build scripts are written in xml which is very chatty
  * Build scripts are interpreted. Errors come back at runtime instead of during editing
  * Intellisense is possible but requires adding a schema and configuration to each developer system
  * Getting started has a learning curve

=== 2. Why not use MSBuild? ===
  * Build scripts are written in xml which is very chatty
  * Build scripts are interpreted. Errors come back at runtime instead of during editing
  * Intellisense is possible but requires adding a schema and configuration to each developer system
  * It is good at building a project but doing other tasks is usually challenging
  * No support for tokenization
  * Getting started has a learning curve higher than NAnt

=== 3. Why not use PSake? ===
  * Build scripts are interpreted. Errors come back at runtime instead of during editing
  * Intellisense is possible if you use a tool like Power Console
  * It requires powershell to be installed on all systems running the build script
  * Need to be familiar with powershell syntax

=== 4. Do I have to build my build script then run that? ===
No. That would be silly. The build runner takes EITHER a pre-compiled build dll or else a path to the folder containing your build scripts. If a folder is provided it will compile the build scripts and then run them.
