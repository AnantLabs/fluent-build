#summary How to get started using FluentBuild

Getting started is quite easy.

  # Create a C# project to contain your builds (currently the only language supported)
  # Create a class named Default that inherits from FluentBuild.Core.BuildFile
  # In your constructor call AddTask() for each method you want the build to run.  
  # Place fb.exe and FluentBuild.dll in a convenient folder.
  # run fb.exe path/to/build/folder (NOTE: it is the path to the FOLDER that contains the build file(s), not the path to the build file itself)
  # fb.exe will then compile the build file and then execute it. 

For an example of what you can do see the [SampleBuildClass sample build class] or read the Tutorial
