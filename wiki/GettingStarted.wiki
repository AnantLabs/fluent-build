#summary How to get started using FluentBuild

Getting started is quite easy.

  # Create a C# build file (vb is currently not supported). It can be a standalone file or part of a project (a project is easier as you can reference FluentBuild.dll and get intellisense).
  # Place fb.exe and FluentBuild.dll in a convenient folder.
  # run fb.exe path/to/build/folder (NOTE: it is the path to the FOLDER that contains the build file, not the path to the build file itself)
  # fb.exe will then compile the build file and then execute it.
