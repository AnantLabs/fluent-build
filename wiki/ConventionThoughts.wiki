#summary Some ideas around conventions

= Convention Thoughts =

I do want to add some convention support in once we have the baseline interface built and functioning. Once people start to use it then patterns should emerge.


For Tokenization it would be nice to have:
{{{
file.ReplaceTokens.OutputFileTo(finalFile);

or

file.Copy.ReplaceTokens.To(finalFile);

}}}
This may use reflection to map all parameters to variables in the code.
